# Coinmarketcap parser
Coinmarketcap parser of NFT tokens

To use the parser download 4 files: "__init_\_.py", "data.py", "download.py" and "parse.py". Then run "__init_\_.py" and wait for results. 

Take into account that you should install several packages used in the project!

You can make experiments with other URLs of coinmarketcap quotes, for example from the main page.

In crypto.json and crypto.csv you can see program execution results.
